Each row corresponds to a synthetic patient profile with standardized predictor values including age, sex, bmi, bp, and various serum measurements (s1 to s6). The outcome column was computed using a logistic regression model that was originally trained on the real dataset. It indicates the predicted class for each synthetic observation, where a value of 1 signifies a positive prediction (presence of disease) and 0 signifies a negative prediction (absence of disease). In this output, all five examples have been classified as 1, suggesting that the logistic model predicted a high probability of disease presence for each bootstrapped patient profile. This step ensures that the newly generated dataset maintains realistic relationships between predictors and outcomes, as required by the assignment instructions."

        "After generating the bootstrapped dataset and computing the outcomes using the logistic regression model, an XGBoost classifier was trained using 5-fold cross-validation. The model achieved a mean accuracy of 1.00, indicating that it correctly predicted the outcomes for all observations across all validation folds. This exceptionally high performance is expected because the outcomes were generated based on a model-driven process, where the relationship between predictors and outcomes was already captured during bootstrapping. The training and evaluation process was also highly efficient, with the total time taken for cross-validation being approximately 0.22 seconds, demonstrating the speed and scalability of XGBoost for relatively small datasets."

        "A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance and scalability of the XGBoost classifier across different dataset sizes generated via bootstrapping. The datasets included 100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000, and 1,000,000 synthetic observations. The model consistently achieved a mean accuracy of 1.00 for all datasets containing 1,000 rows and above, indicating perfect predictive performance. For the smallest dataset (100 rows), the model achieved a slightly lower but still strong accuracy of 0.95. This result aligns with expectations, as smaller datasets generally carry higher variance and less information for model training. In terms of computational efficiency, the training time scaled predictably with dataset size, increasing from 0.16 seconds for 100 rows to approximately 27.79 seconds for 1 million rows. These results demonstrate that XGBoost is both highly accurate and highly scalable when applied to structured, predictable datasets generated from logistic models."
